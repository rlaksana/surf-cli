# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.18.0] - 2026-09-04

### Highlights
- Record long-running browser sessions as local WebM videos.
- Use GPT-6 Astra with Pro effort through Surf Oracle and Pi's `gpt-pro` integration.
- Clean up stale or idle Surf sessions with an optional dry run.
- Share local Surf access with a dedicated user group while keeping private access as the default.

### Added
- **Local WebM video recording** - Record browser sessions with `surf video start|stop|status|restart`. Requires ffmpeg with VP9 support and runs locally only. Existing GIF recording is unchanged.
- **Session cleanup** - `surf session.cleanup --idle-after <duration> [--dry-run]` removes stale or idle session bindings and closes only inactive Surf-created tabs or windows. Thanks to [@marcoatpaladin](https://github.com/marcoatpaladin) for #233.
- **Optional local socket sharing** - `surf install` can grant a configured POSIX group access with socket mode `660`. Private mode `0600` remains the default. Thanks to [@marcoatpaladin](https://github.com/marcoatpaladin) for #225.

### Changed
- **GPT Pro default** - Pi's packaged `gpt-pro` integration now uses GPT-6 Astra with Pro effort.
- **ChatGPT selection options** - Model choices include `gpt-6-astra`, `latest`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, and `gpt-5.5`. Effort options are now `instant`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`/`extra-high`, and `pro`, replacing the previous effort names. Explicit GPT-6 Astra requests fail rather than silently switching models when ChatGPT hides the model version; use `latest` only when floating model selection is intended.
- **Development dependencies** - Updated development tooling dependencies.

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT model and effort selection** - Surf works with ChatGPT's current model menu and effort slider, checks the selected values, and closes the menu between operations. The requested model is checked again before the prompt is sent.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-08-28

### Highlights
- GPT Pro Oracle runs can now include one local file as context.
- GPT Pro follow-ups can attach a file without losing the current conversation.
- Repository-aware GPT Pro runs can require ChatGPT's Chat mode and GitHub tool before Surf submits the prompt.

### Added
- **GPT Pro Oracle attachments** - `surf oracle ask` and `surf oracle follow` now accept `--file <path>` to attach one local file to ChatGPT GPT Pro runs.
- **GPT Pro GitHub context** - `surf oracle ask` and `surf oracle follow` now accept `--github` to require ChatGPT's Chat tab and connected GitHub tool before submission.
- **Pi Oracle options** - Surf's Pi tool and external-job provider now forward explicit file and GitHub context options.

### Fixed
- **Attachment error reporting** - Oracle attachment failures now preserve clearer file access, selector, file chooser, and ChatGPT processing error details.

## [2.16.1] - 2026-08-23

### Highlights
- GPT Pro jobs now clear stale composer text before submitting a prompt.
- Pro effort verification now waits until ChatGPT has the real prompt in the composer.
- Text-only GPT Pro runs and follow-ups are less fragile in reused ChatGPT tabs.

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT Pro effort verification** - Surf now clears stale composer text, types the prompt, and verifies the Pro effort from the composer picker before submitting.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-08-23

### Highlights
- Pi integrations can now continue GPT Pro conversations through Surf Oracle follow-up jobs.
- GPT Pro job polling is more reliable because status checks can observe finished jobs directly.
- Cancelled GPT Pro jobs now stay cancelled instead of being reported as failed.

### Added
- **GPT Pro follow-ups** - Surf Oracle now records repeat-safe request IDs and follow-up lineage so Pi integrations can continue GPT Pro conversations.

### Fixed
- **Pi GPT Pro polling** - The `surf-oracle` provider now checks for completed jobs during status and reattach calls, so Pi can observe finished GPT Pro jobs without an extra result request.
- **Pi GPT Pro cancellation** - Cancelled Surf Oracle requests now keep their cancellation state instead of being reported as failed jobs.

## [2.15.2] - 2026-08-22

### Highlights
- Pi users can run the packaged `gpt-pro` agent against ChatGPT's current GPT-5.6 Sol Pro controls.
- `Pro` is now selected as an effort setting instead of being treated like a model name.
- GPT Pro jobs are less fragile when ChatGPT separates model and effort choices in the picker.

### Fixed
- **GPT Pro package agent** - The packaged `gpt-pro` Pi agent now requests ChatGPT `GPT-5.6 Sol` with `Pro` effort, matching the current ChatGPT model and effort controls.

## [2.15.1] - 2026-08-20

### Highlights
- Pi users can run the packaged `gpt-pro` agent through Surf when ChatGPT is open and logged in.
- Device aliases such as `iphone`, `pixel`, and `ipadpro` now resolve to the same presets everywhere.
- Help text and release notes now point users at the right commands and current release details.

### Changed
- **Dependency maintenance** - Updated Puppeteer to 25.6.0 and aligned the real-Chrome CI pin to 151.0.7922.77.
- **Docs and help text** - The README now links to the changelog for current release notes, and the packaged Surf skill labels `surf --help` as basic help while keeping `surf --help-full` as the full command list.

### Fixed
- **Pi GPT Pro jobs** - Surf now registers `surf-oracle` with pi-subagents' external-job contract, so Pi can run packaged `gpt-pro` jobs through Surf against ChatGPT web mode when the browser is logged in. Capacity errors now include the blocking job id.
- **Device aliases** - Extension-side device emulation now resolves aliases before fuzzy matching, so `iphone`, `pixel`, `galaxy`, and similar names match the native preset list.
- **AI Studio parse errors** - Invalid GenerateContent responses now keep the original parse error as the cause.
- **Extension cleanup** - Removed unused extension transport and debug exports.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-08-19

### Highlights
- Named browser sessions: bind work to a specific tab with `session.new`, `--session`, or `SURF_SESSION`, and manage it with list/info/close/rebind/reopen commands.
- Multiple sessions can now run commands at the same time, each tab keeping its own order.
- Clearer errors: session and scheduler failures include a copy-paste recovery command.
- Optional GPT Pro agent for Pi users: ask ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol Pro web mode through the packaged `gpt-pro` agent.

### Added
- **Durable browser sessions** - Added `session.new`, idempotent `session.ensure`, list/info/close/rebind/reopen commands, `--session`, and `SURF_SESSION` for explicit tab-bound work.
- **Concurrent tab lanes** - Different session tabs can execute concurrently while each tab remains FIFO; browser-wide mutations and browser-login provider flows remain exclusive.
- **GPT Pro package agent** - Surf now ships an optional `gpt-pro` agent for `pi-subagents` users, backed by ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol Pro web mode.

### Changed
- **Recovery guidance** - Session and scheduler errors now include copy-paste recovery commands, `session.info` reports queue blockers, and provider tools warn before taking exclusive browser access.
- **Strict target safety** - Session commands never fall back to the active tab, and screenshot fallback refuses to capture a different visible tab.
- **Surf skill guidance** - Updated iframe and batch examples for session-based workflows.
- **Pi external-job options** - The `surf-oracle` provider now honors `options.model` and `options.effort`, so Pi agent profiles can request ChatGPT GPT-5.6 Sol with Pro effort via `model: gpt-5.6-sol` and `effort: pro`.
- **Dependency maintenance** - Updated dev dependencies: `@types/node` 26.2.0, `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.8, and `typebox` 1.3.14.

### Fixed
- **Batch iframe targeting** - Selector clicks in a batch now use the selected session frame after `frame.switch`.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Surf Oracle provider for Pi** - Added a stable `surf-oracle` provider so Pi integrations can start, check, resume, follow, and collect Surf Oracle jobs through durable job state.

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT Pro model alias** - Fixed `surf oracle --model pro` so it selects and verifies the current GPT-5.6 Sol model. Explicit GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.6 Sol selection still work, and the Pro effort selector is unchanged.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-08-09

### Changed
- **Dependency maintenance** - Updated Vite to 8.2.1, Biome to 2.5.7, Puppeteer to 25.5.0, and Chrome types to 0.2.5.
- **Real Chrome E2E** - Updated the pinned Chrome for Testing version to 151.0.7922.71 for Puppeteer 25.5.0.

### Fixed
- **Windows private state** - Skip unsupported POSIX permission-bit checks when reading private state files on Windows. Thanks to Andrey Oz (@ozand) for #181.
- **Chrome test mocks** - Add the required tab `lastAccessed` value for the updated Chrome type definitions.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Kimi AI integration** - Added `surf kimi` for Kimi browser-session queries and validation. Thanks to @jagaliano for #178.

### Changed
- **Pi extension background bridge** - Prefer the official `pi-subagents/background-work` helper when Pi loads Surf with pi-subagents available, while keeping the global fallback for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, direct CLI use, and other non-Pi harnesses.

### Fixed
- **Pi skill discovery** - Added frontmatter to the packaged `skills/README.md` index so Pi no longer reports it as a root skill with a missing description. Thanks to @jagaliano for #177.
- **Pi oracle wake channel** - Emit `surf-oracle:finished` when Surf observes a terminal oracle result so pi-subagents can wake without waiting for the next snapshot poll.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Pi extension** - Added optional Pi browser tools backed by Surf's native-host socket, plus optional pi-subagents background reporting for session-owned oracle jobs.
- **Rendered page HTML** - Added `surf page.html` to print and `surf page.save --output <path>` to save the current rendered document HTML, with `--selector <css>` and `--strip-scripts` for bounded static exports of Claude artifacts or other rendered pages.
- **Playbook script strategies** - Added opt-in trusted read-op scripts with dynamic `tools.run`/`tools.all` Surf tool orchestration and workflow auto-waits.

### Changed
- **TypeScript boundary cleanup** - Replaced content element ref expandos with a WeakMap and validated native API stream response frames before dispatch.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Durable ChatGPT oracle jobs** - Added `surf oracle ask|status|result|follow|list` with recoverable conversation-backed jobs, repeatable context globs, and fail-closed context, model, and effort gates.

### Changed
- **Extension icon** - Replaced the placeholder teal glyph with on-brand artwork matching the project banner: a cartoon wave curl with the surfing robot mascot, tuned to stay legible at 16px in the browser toolbar.
- **ChatGPT model selection** - `surf chatgpt --model` now fails closed with `model_verification_failed` when the requested model cannot be verified as selected instead of continuing with the current model.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Surf Playbooks** - Added durable browser-session playbooks with `surf playbook`/`surf pb` management, `surf use` execution, workflow and network strategies, host-owned write receipts, private activity/record state, record drafting, trace export, and standalone client projection.

### Dependencies
- **Routine toolchain refresh** - Updated Biome to 2.5.5, Vite to 8.1.5, and the setup-node Action to v7.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Real Chrome E2E coverage** - Added a pinned Chrome for Testing CI lane that exercises the production MV3 extension, native messaging, core CLI navigation and page commands, interaction, visual indicators, screenshot bytes, and process cleanup against local fixtures. Thanks to Carlos Villela (@cv) for #7.
- **Authenticated Tailnet remote control** - Added mutually authenticated per-client remote access with Ed25519 host pinning, authorize/list/revoke lifecycle, shared local/remote FIFO serialization, disconnect cancellation, bounded single-file transfer, explicit `local:`/`remote:` path semantics, remote AI attachments and image outputs, network export, and transferred action/error screenshots. Thanks to @alvinunreal for the original remote-browser contribution in #155.
- **Deep X Research skill** - Added `skills/deep-x-research/`, an agent skill that layers an exhaustive X (Twitter) research procedure on top of `surf grok`: a quota-budgeted multi-angle Grok sweep (keyword + semantic, with DeepSearch), Grok-native video analysis, quota-free URL verification via direct post opens, categorized findings, and a References section where every cited post carries its full post URL. Falls back to the x.com search UI when the Grok quota is exhausted.
- **Tab movement** - Added `surf tab.move <id> --to-window <id>` with multi-tab and insertion-index support. (@zm2231, #148)
- **Page text byte limit** - Added `page.read --max-bytes <n>` for UTF-8-safe visible-text truncation without changing the existing default limit. (@zm2231, #148)

### Fixed
- **Real Chrome test setup** - Require the lockfile's project-local Puppeteer and pinned Chrome build before running the browser E2E, with exact setup guidance instead of falling back to unrelated parent installs.
- **Content-script message routing** - Routed accessibility and visual-indicator commands through one authoritative Chrome message listener so unrelated listeners cannot win the response race and return empty results.
- **Provider response extraction** - Fixed truncated Perplexity answers, trailing Grok suggestion chips, and incomplete Gemini stream/image extraction; refreshed Gemini's selectable web models and unknown-model fallback guidance. (@zm2231, #148)
- **Browser command edge cases** - Fixed `tab.name` on restricted active pages, `zoom --level` argument loss, and selector-targeted `type --into`; selector typing now follows the active iframe context. (@zm2231, #148)

### Docs
- **Skills README** - Documented the two-skill layout (`surf/` reference, `deep-x-research/` procedure) with install steps for Pi, Claude Code, and Codex, and pointed the surf skill's Grok section at `deep-x-research` for exhaustive research tasks.

### Dependencies
- **Routine toolchain refresh** - Updated Gitleaks Action to v3, checkout Action to v7, Zod to 4.4.3, Chrome types to 0.2.2, the Vite Node polyfills plugin to 0.28.0, and the resolved Vitest package group to 4.1.10.
- **TypeScript 7** - Updated the TypeScript compiler from 6.0.3 to 7.0.2.
- **Vite 8** - Updated Vite from 7.3.1 to 8.1.4 with the compatible Node polyfills plugin, moving extension builds to Vite's Rolldown and Oxc toolchain.
- **Biome 2.5.4** - Updated Biome from 2.4.4 to 2.5.4, migrated its configuration, and adjusted conditional tests for the stricter lint analysis.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Native host diagnostics** - Added `surf doctor` to diagnose socket connectivity, native messaging manifests, allowed origins, and wrapper paths without requiring a working browser connection.
- **Performance audit** - Added `surf perf-audit --duration ... --trigger ... --output ...` for bounded PerformanceObserver snapshots of layout shifts, events, long tasks, paints, and long animation frames. (@SeMmyT)
- **Animation recording** - Added `surf record --duration ... --fps ... --output ...` to capture screenshot bursts and assemble animated GIFs with ImageMagick. (@SeMmyT)
- **Browser request lock** - Added per-socket CLI request serialization for multi-agent workflows, with `--no-lock` for intentional bypasses. (@SeMmyT)
- **Animation audit** - Added `surf animate-audit --selector ... --duration ... --fps ...` for bounded JSON timelines of element rect/style samples. (@SeMmyT)
- **Concurrency docs** - Documented the pre-session isolation contract available in 2.8.0: window/tab targeting, named tabs, and separate `SURF_SOCKET` instances.
- **LLM context flag** - Added `surf --llm-context` as a compact, deterministic quick reference for AI agents. (@SeMmyT)
- **CLI/native socket integration coverage** - Added CI-safe integration tests for Surf CLI request framing, fake native-host responses, host errors, and missing-socket diagnostics.
- **Native host protocol integration coverage** - Added CI-safe tests for `native/host.cjs` native-messaging framing, CLI request forwarding, extension responses, and extension error propagation without real Chrome.
- **E2E-contract coverage** - Added CI-safe real CLI plus real native-host tests with a fake native-messaging extension for browser-like navigation, page text, page read, and screenshot flows without Chrome.
- **Scroll shorthand** - `surf scroll` now accepts positional forms like `scroll down 800`, `scroll up 400`, `scroll bottom`, and `scroll top` while keeping existing flag and dot-command forms. (@SeMmyT)
- **Cookie subcommands** - Added space-separated cookie commands (`surf cookie list`, `get`, `set`, `clear --all`, and `delete`) while keeping existing `cookie.*` commands working. (@SeMmyT)

### Fixed
- **Socket failure guidance** - Socket connection errors now point users to `surf doctor --browser all` for detailed native-host diagnostics.
- **ChatGPT file upload** - `surf chatgpt --file <path>` now uploads the file through the ChatGPT composer before sending the prompt, with provider-specific upload errors.
- **Gemini upload menu selector** - Accept Gemini's current `Upload & tools` opener while preserving the legacy upload menu selector.
- **Screenshot full-page alias** - Treat `surf screenshot --full-page` the same as `--fullpage`, including explicit output paths. (@SeMmyT)
- **Resize shorthand parsing** - `surf resize 375 812` now maps positional width and height, while `surf resize 375` sets width only. (@SeMmyT)
- **Grok UI drift** - Updated default model selection for the current Grok menu, broadened send-button validation, and trimmed trailing suggested follow-up chips from extracted responses.
- **WSL2 native messaging host install** - Install/uninstall now target Windows browser manifests from WSL2 by default, preserve manifest origins, forward wrapper arguments, and include clearer socket diagnostics. (@SeMmyT)
- **JavaScript expression evaluation** - `surf js` now returns single-expression values while preserving statement-script fallback behavior. (@SeMmyT)
- **Baseline CI validation** - Restored lint, typecheck, tests, and critical audit checks on current dependencies.
- **Native messaging host portability** - Generated Unix wrappers now use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` so Chrome can launch the host on NixOS, Guix, and other non-FHS Linux systems. (@ppetru)
- **Gemini blob-backed generated images** - Detect and extract Gemini-generated `blob:` images from the page while preserving existing `gg-dl` URL downloads. (@goneflyin)
- **Accessibility tree nested labels** - Include nested text content when naming interactive links, buttons, and summaries so child spans contribute accessible names. (@skyeryg)

### Docs
- **macOS native host troubleshooting** - Added a focused checklist for Chrome native messaging manifests, extension IDs, service-worker logs, and matching `SURF_SOCKET` values.

### Dependencies
- Bump Vitest package group from 4.0.18 to 4.1.9 to clear the critical audit advisory.
- Bump TypeScript from 5.7.2 to 6.0.3.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT login detection** - Accept chunked NextAuth session cookies such as `__Secure-next-auth.session-token.0` during login checks, matching ChatGPT's current cookie layout. (@mplibunao)
- **ChatGPT response extraction** - Improved assistant turn detection and completion polling so responses are still captured when ChatGPT's DOM structure shifts or thinking output renders through newer turn containers. (@mplibunao, @Julian194)
- **ChatGPT model selection** - Updated `surf chatgpt --model` to match the current ChatGPT model menu and select `Instant`, `Thinking`, and `Pro` reliably.
- **ChatGPT error reporting** - Preserve `/backend-api/me` login check failures instead of downgrading them to a generic `ChatGPT login required` error.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Scroll command failing silently** - Fixed `surf scroll` not working on sites with `scroll-behavior: smooth` (e.g., component.gallery). CDP `mouseWheel` events were silently ignored on these sites. Now uses `window.scrollBy()` via script evaluation, which works reliably on all sites.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Gemini image generation** (`surf gemini --generate-image`) - Generate images via UI automation. Google made image generation session-bound, blocking external HTTP requests. This feature automates the browser UI: opens a Gemini tab, types the prompt, clicks send, polls for generated images, and downloads via the extension's credentialed fetch.
- **Gemini image editing** (`surf gemini --edit-image`) - Edit existing images with text prompts. Uses CDP file chooser interception to upload images, then follows the same UI automation flow as generation.

### Fixed
- **Gemini file upload reliability** - Added retry logic (3 attempts with 10s/15s/20s timeouts) and stale menu handling for the file chooser flow.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **AI Studio provider** (`surf aistudio`) - Query Gemini models via aistudio.google.com using your browser session. Supports `--model` for best-effort model selection and `--with-page` to include current page context. Extracts responses from both DOM and network (GenerateContent RPC), with thinking-model support. (co-authored by @w-winter)
- **AI Studio App Builder** (`surf aistudio.build`) - Automate AI Studio's App Builder to generate web apps from a text prompt. Downloads the result as a zip file and optionally extracts it to `--output`. Supports `--model`, `--timeout`, and `--keep-open`.
- **Windows support** - Named pipes for socket paths, `SURF_TMP` for temp files, ImageMagick quoting fixes, skip Unix-only `unlinkSync`/`chmodSync`. (@marcfargas)
- **Helium browser support** - Detect and connect to Helium browser alongside Chrome. (@aliou)
- **Env var overrides** - `SURF_SOCKET_PATH`, `SURF_HOST_PATH`, and `SURF_MANIFEST_PATH` for package manager installs. (@aliou)
- **Skills in npm package** - Skills directory now included in published package. (@aliou)

### Fixed
- **CLI --version** - Read version dynamically from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded constant. (@davidguttman)

### Dependencies
- Bump `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` from 0.24.0 to 0.25.0

## [2.5.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **CLI version display** - Fixed hardcoded VERSION constant showing "2.0.0" instead of actual version

### Docs
- **SKILL.md overhaul** - Comprehensive update with all v2.1-2.5 features including semantic locators, workflows with loops/arguments, frame context, window isolation, and more

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Gemini client hanging** - Fixed HTTP requests hanging indefinitely when called through native messaging host. Root cause was missing `content-length` header - Node.js failed to auto-calculate content length in the native messaging stdio context, causing the server to wait for more data that never came.
- **Gemini SSL/TLS** - Added `rejectUnauthorized: false` for Gemini API requests (matches Python library behavior)
- **Gemini host header** - Added explicit `host: gemini.google.com` header required by Google's servers

### Improved
- **HTTP request robustness** - Added explicit timeouts, better error handling, and debug logging throughout the Gemini client
- **Buffer handling** - Proper UTF-8 encoding for POST request bodies

## [2.5.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Named workflows** - Save workflows as JSON files in `~/.surf/workflows/` (user) or `./.surf/workflows/` (project) and run by name: `surf do my-workflow --arg1 value`
- **Workflow arguments** - Define typed arguments with `required` and `default` values. Variable substitution via `%{argname}` syntax in step args.
- **Step outputs** - Capture step results with `as` field for use in later steps: `{ "tool": "js", "args": {...}, "as": "result" }`
- **Loops** - `repeat` for fixed iterations, `each` for array iteration, with optional `until` exit condition:
  ```json
  { "repeat": 5, "steps": [...] }
  { "each": "%{items}", "as": "item", "steps": [...] }
  { "repeat": 20, "until": { "tool": "js", "args": {...} }, "steps": [...] }
  ```
- **Workflow discovery commands**:
  - `surf workflow.list` - List available workflows
  - `surf workflow.info <name>` - Show workflow details, arguments, and steps
  - `surf workflow.validate <file>` - Validate workflow JSON structure
- **Workflow metadata** - `name`, `description`, and `args` schema in workflow files for documentation and validation

### Changed
- **Dry-run output improved** - Shows workflow name, description, formatted steps with loop structure, and resolved variables

## [2.4.2] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **Grok response detection** - Fixed timeout issues where Grok responses were visible in the browser but not detected by the CLI. Improved completion detection by:
  - Using DOM-based response extraction (articles, conversation containers) instead of relying on body text parsing
  - Tracking response text stability rather than noisy full-page body text
  - Recognizing "Thought for Xs" as a definitive completion signal for thinking models
  - Fixing false positive "isThinking" detection that matched Grok model names
- **Grok thinking model support** - Long-running thinking queries (1+ minutes) now reliably return complete responses

## [2.4.1] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Workflow syntax** - Pipe separator `|` is now the primary way to chain commands inline:
  `surf do 'go "https://example.com" | click e5 | screenshot'`
  Newlines still supported for file-based workflows and heredocs.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Workflow execution** - New `surf do` command to execute multi-step browser workflows as a single operation. Reduces token overhead and improves reliability for common automation sequences.
  - Inline workflows: `surf do 'go "url" | click e5 | screenshot'`
  - File-based workflows: `surf do --file workflow.json`
  - Dry run validation: `surf do '...' --dry-run`
  - Smart auto-waits after navigation, clicks, and form submissions
  - Configurable error handling: `--on-error stop|continue`
  - Adjustable step delay: `--step-delay 200` (or `0` to disable)
  - JSON output: `--json` for structured results
  - Tab/window targeting: `--tab-id`, `--window-id`
- **Workflow parser** - Newline-separated command syntax with comment support (`#` lines), quote-aware tokenization, and automatic alias resolution.
- **Workflow executor** - Sequential execution with streaming progress output, command-specific auto-waits (wait.load for navigation, wait.dom for clicks), and variable substitution support (`%{varname}` syntax for Phase 2).
- **Workflow unit tests** - 42 new tests covering parser tokenization, command parsing, and executor auto-wait logic.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-01-20

### Changed
- Added tropical beach banner image to README with robot surfing, Chrome logos, and palm trees.
- Added npm version, license, and platform badges to README.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Grok AI integration** - Query X.com's Grok AI via `surf grok "query"`. Supports `--with-page` for context, `--deep-search` for DeepSearch mode, and `--model` for model selection. Requires X.com login in Chrome.
- **Grok validation command** - `surf grok --validate` checks UI structure and lists available models. Use `--save-models` to persist discovered models to `surf.json` config for when X updates their UI.
- **Grok response warnings** - Agents receive warnings when model selection fails or differs from requested, with actionable suggestions to run `--validate`.
- **Grok unit tests** - 17 new tests covering response extraction, cookie validation, and model loading.

### Fixed
- Fixed AI query response detection being too slow due to overly strict completion checks.
- Fixed short responses (like "4" for math queries) not being detected due to minimum length requirement.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- **Element styles inspection** - New `element.styles` command to get computed CSS styles from elements. Returns font, color, background, border, padding, and bounding box. Accepts refs or CSS selectors.
- **Dropdown select command** - New `select` command to select options in `<select>` dropdowns. Supports single/multi-select, matching by value (default), label, or index.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- **Frame context for iframe support** - `frame.switch` now properly affects subsequent commands (`page.read`, `locate.*`, `click`, `search`, etc.). Switch to an iframe and all content script operations target that frame.
- **Semantic locators** - `locate.role`, `locate.text`, `locate.label` commands to find elements by ARIA role, text content, or label. Supports `--action click|fill|hover|text` to act on found elements.
- **Device emulation** - `emulate.device` with 19 device presets (iPhone, iPad, Pixel, Galaxy, Nest Hub). Includes `emulate.viewport`, `emulate.touch` for custom configurations.
- **Performance tracing** - `perf.start`, `perf.stop`, `perf.metrics` for capturing Chrome performance traces.
- **Page read optimization** - `--depth` and `--compact` flags for `page.read` to reduce output size for LLM efficiency.
- **Window isolation for multi-agent workflows** - New `window.*` commands (`new`, `list`, `focus`, `close`, `resize`) and `--window-id` global option. Agents can work in separate browser windows without interfering with user browsing.
- **Helpful hints in CLI output** - Commands now show actionable hints (e.g., `window.new` shows how to use `--window-id`)
- **Auto-tab creation** - When targeting a window with only restricted tabs (chrome://, extensions), Surf auto-creates a usable tab
- **Linux support (experimental)** - Added ImageMagick fallback for screenshot resizing, supports both IM6 (`convert`) and IM7 (`magick`). Install script already handles Linux native messaging paths.
- **`surf --help-topic windows`** - New help topic explaining window isolation workflow
- **Screenshot auto-save control** - New `--no-save` flag and `autoSaveScreenshots` config option to disable auto-saving screenshots to `/tmp`. When disabled, returns base64 + ID instead of file path, saving context for agents that don't need the file.
- **Extension disconnect detection** - CLI detects when extension disconnects and exits cleanly with a helpful message
- **Testing infrastructure** - Added vitest with coverage, Chrome API mocks, and network formatter tests
- **Biome linter** - Strict linting for test code with rules for test best practices (no focused/skipped tests, no console, no any, etc.)
- **Perplexity AI integration** - Query Perplexity using browser session via `surf perplexity "query"`. Supports `--with-page` for context, `--mode` for search modes, and `--model` for model selection (Pro features).
- **`surf read` now includes visible text by default** - Reduces agent round-trips by returning both accessibility tree and page text content in one call. Use `--no-text` to get only interactive elements.

### Changed
- `surf read` behavior changed: now includes `--- Page Text ---` section by default
- Added `--no-text` flag to `surf read` to exclude text content (previous default behavior)
- `tab.list` now respects `--window-id` to show only tabs in that window
- `tab.new` now respects `--window-id` to create tabs in a specific window

### Fixed
- Fixed `locate.role`, `locate.text`, `locate.label`, `emulate.device`, `frame.js` not accepting positional arguments (missing from PRIMARY_ARG_MAP)
- Fixed `emulate.device --list` requiring a tab when it shouldn't (added to COMMANDS_WITHOUT_TAB)
- Fixed `surf screenshot` without `--output` returning an unusable in-memory ID instead of saving to file. Now auto-saves to `/tmp/surf-snap-*.png` like the `snap` alias, ensuring agents always get a usable file path. The `screenshotId` is still returned for use with `upload_image` workflow.
- Fixed MCP server `screenshot` tool not accepting `output` parameter (was only accepting `savePath`)
- Fixed frame context not being used by most content script operations (now `frame.switch` properly affects `page.read`, `locate.*`, `click`, `type`, `search`, etc.)
- Fixed frame context memory leak on tab close
- Fixed frame context not clearing on page navigation
- Fixed device emulation matching preferring shorter names ("iPhone 14" over "iPhone 14 Pro" when user typed "iphone14pro")
- Fixed `--depth` not being parsed as integer for `page.read`
- Fixed device presets out of sync between CLI and extension (now 19 devices in both)
- Fixed `performLocateAction` helper not respecting frame context for `--action` operations
- Fixed internal message `id` leaking into JSON output for window commands
- Fixed `windowId` not being forwarded from CLI through native host to extension
- Fixed `tab.new` not creating tabs in the specified window when using `--window-id`
- Fixed `tab.list` not filtering by window when using `--window-id`
- Fixed `tab.list` showing no output when no tabs exist (now shows helpful message)
- Fixed `--window-id` and `--tab-id` not being parsed as integers (caused Chrome API errors with helpful validation)
- Fixed ImageMagick 7 compatibility (`magick identify` fallback for systems without standalone `identify`)
- Fixed text content not being included when screenshots were also present in page read responses

### Removed
- Removed `session.*` commands - sessions couldn't actually provide profile isolation via native messaging (use `window.new --incognito` for cookie isolation instead)
- Removed non-functional base64 image output from CLI (was not being interpreted by agents)
