# Surf Browser Automation

Control Chrome browser via CLI or Unix socket.

## Subagent Return Contract

If this skill is loaded directly in the main agent context by a slash command and the request requires substantive browser automation, AI query, testing, or research work, do not perform the surf workflow in the main context. Immediately spawn an `Agent` subagent to execute `surf` normally with the user's arguments and this skill's CLI conventions, then wait for its `LSC_RETURN — Lossless Semantic Compression` result. Do not recursively delegate when already inside a subagent. Continue inline only for trivial usage/argument validation or when `Agent` is unavailable; if so, keep output compact and state the limitation.

When `surf` is executed inside a subagent, run this skill normally, then return to the main agent only in compact **Lossless Semantic Compression (LSC)** format. Do not return raw process, long reasoning, raw logs, raw browser dumps, full transcripts, full files, full diffs, or repeated context unless the caller explicitly requested raw detail. Preserve meaning through evidence/detail pointers so full detail remains recoverable.

Use this exact template:

```text
LSC_RETURN — Lossless Semantic Compression

STATUS:
done | partial | blocked

OUTCOME:
<one short paragraph with the useful result>

FACTS:
- <load-bearing fact> → <evidence pointer>

DECISION:
<decision or conclusion, if any> → <reason> → <evidence pointer>

DELTA:
- <new finding/change only>

VERIFY:
- <check/test/source>: pass | fail | not run | found | not found

RISK:
- <severity>: <remaining risk or uncertainty>

NEXT:
- <next concrete action>

TABS:                                          # REQUIRED for every surf run
- opened: <count> (ids: [<id1>, <id2>, ...])
- closed: <count>
- still_open: <count>  // must equal opened - closed
- pre_existing_preserved: true | false

DETAIL:
- <URL/provider/command/screenshot/artifact/query where full detail can be reopened>
```

Evidence pointers should use the smallest recoverable locator available: URL, provider name, surf command, page ref, screenshot path, downloaded artifact path, report section, timestamped run note, or query.

## Tab Discipline (Mandatory)

Surf shares the user's real Chrome profile. Every tab the agent opens is a real tab in the user's browser. Tab clutter and focus-stealing are user-visible side effects, not cosmetic concerns. The following two rules are mandatory defaults for every surf invocation — including ones delegated to subagents.

### Rule 1 — Open research tabs in the background

The user's currently focused tab MUST NOT change as a side effect of surf work.

- Open research URLs with `surf tab.new <url>`. By default it does not steal focus — the user's current tab stays active.
- **Do not call `surf tab.switch` on a research tab** to read it. Read with `surf page.read --tab-id <id>` instead — that reads without switching focus.
- **Do not use `surf navigate <research-url>`** for research URLs. `surf navigate` overwrites the user's current tab. Use `tab.new` for any new URL you want to investigate.
- **Do not call `surf window.new` for "isolation"** unless the user explicitly asks for it. New windows steal focus and clutter the user's taskbar.
- `surf screenshot` accepts `--tab-id <id>` to capture without switching.
- `surf read`, `surf click`, `surf type`, etc. all accept `--tab-id` — prefer that over `tab.switch` whenever possible.

### Rule 2 — Auto-close every tab the agent opens

Every tab opened by the agent MUST be closed as soon as its purpose is complete — either at the end of the step that needed it, or at the end of the run via a single batch.

- `surf tab.close <id>` closes one tab.
- `surf tab.close --ids <id1> <id2> ...` closes many.
- Track every tab ID you opened. Do not close pre-existing user tabs you did not create.
- On error or unexpected exit, close any tab the agent created. Never leave orphan tabs behind.

### Updated LSC contract — mandatory tab accounting

The LSC return MUST include these fields in addition to the existing template (place between `NEXT:` and `DETAIL:`):

```
TABS:
- opened: <count> (ids: [<id1>, <id2>, ...])
- closed: <count>
- still_open: <count>  // must equal opened - closed
- pre_existing_preserved: true | false
```

### Delegation prompt requirements

When delegating surf research to a subagent, the delegation prompt MUST include Rules 1 and 2 verbatim or near-verbatim. Phrases like "jangan close", "preserve research tabs", "biarkan terbuka", or "leave tabs open for user to read" are red flags and MUST be rewritten before the prompt is sent — they defeat Rule 2.

### Carve-out

The mandatory rules apply by default. One explicit exception: when the user themselves drives an interactive browsing session (e.g., "open this URL and tell me what you see" with intent that the user also sees the new tab), `tab.switch` is appropriate. The LSC tab-accounting fields are still required.

### Anti-pattern summary

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `surf navigate <research-url>` | Overwrites user's current tab | `surf tab.new <research-url>` + `page.read --tab-id <id>` |
| `surf tab.switch <research-tab>` | Steals user focus | `page.read --tab-id <id>` (no switch) |
| Delegation prompt with "jangan close" / "preserve research tabs" | Defeats Rule 2 | Rewrite the prompt; tabs auto-close |
| `surf window.new` for isolation without asking | Steals focus + window clutter | Skip unless the user asks |
| Closing user's pre-existing tab | Destructive | Preserve all tabs the agent did not create |
| Screenshotting without `--tab-id` | Implies `tab.switch` | Pass `--tab-id <id>` |

## Native Host / Socket Notes

For WSL2 with Windows Chrome, run `surf install <extension-id>` inside WSL2. Surf detects WSL2 and writes the Windows-side native messaging manifest plus a wrapper that launches the WSL host. Use `surf install <extension-id> --target linux` only for Linux browsers running inside WSLg.

On macOS, Chrome reads the native messaging manifest at `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/surf.browser.host.json`. If native messaging fails, confirm that file exists, its `allowed_origins` extension ID matches `chrome://extensions`, then rerun `surf install <extension-id>`, restart Chrome, reload the extension, and inspect the extension service-worker console.

If a command reports `Socket connect failed`, run `surf doctor` first, then check the `Attempted socket:` line. Default sockets are `/tmp/surf.sock` on macOS/Linux/WSL2 and `//./pipe/surf` on Windows. If `SURF_SOCKET` is set, the browser-launched host and the shell running `surf` must use the same value.

For opt-in POSIX group sharing, install with `surf install <extension-id> --socket-mode 660 --socket-group <group>`. The default remains `0600`; mode `660` grants every member of that group full Surf authority, so use a dedicated narrow group. Re-run `surf install` without those flags to clear the wrapper settings. Remote Surf credentials remain the revocable per-client alternative.

## Remote Surf

Remote clients require a per-client credential; Tailnet reachability alone is not authorization. On the POSIX browser host, authorize the client before installing the listener:

```bash
surf remote authorize agent-macbook --output ~/agent-macbook.surf-credential.json
surf install <extension-id> --listen 100.101.102.103:4321
surf remote list
```

Move the mode-0600 credential to the client through a secure channel. It grants full trusted Surf authority. Use it explicitly or through `SURF_REMOTE` and `SURF_REMOTE_CREDENTIAL`:

```bash
surf --remote 100.101.102.103:4321 \
  --remote-credential ~/.config/surf/agent-macbook.json \
  page.read

surf remote revoke agent-macbook  # Run on the browser host
```

Remote paths are client-local by default. `local:./file` is explicit client-local syntax; only `remote:/absolute/path` accesses the browser host directly. Remote transfer supports one upload or ChatGPT/Gemini input and one screenshot, network-export, or Gemini image output. Limits are 256 MiB per file, 512 MiB and 32 files per connection, and 256 KiB decoded chunks. `record`, `aistudio.build`, smoke screenshot directories, directories, and multi-file inputs are not supported remotely. Successful action screenshots and failure `--auto-capture` diagnostics are transferred back to client-local paths.

## CLI Quick Reference

```bash
surf --help                    # Basic help
surf <group>                   # Group help (tab, scroll, page, wait, dialog, emulate, form, perf, ai)
surf --help-full               # All commands
surf --find <term>             # Search tools
surf --help-topic <topic>      # Topic guide (refs, semantic, frames, devices, windows)
```

## First Command for Independent Agents

Before the first browser command in each independent agent shell, choose a unique valid session name and ensure its target exists:

```bash
export SURF_SESSION="$(basename "$PWD" | sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]/-/g')"
surf session.ensure "$SURF_SESSION" about:blank
```

`session.ensure` is idempotent. It creates a missing session, reuses a live binding, and reopens a stale or closed tab. Keep `SURF_SESSION` set for every later tab-scoped command in that shell. Use a distinct worktree/directory name per agent; when agents share one directory, append a stable agent identifier. Use `surf session.info "$SURF_SESSION"` to inspect the target and queue state.

## Core Workflow

```bash
# 1. Navigate to page
surf navigate "https://example.com"

# 2. Read page to get element refs
surf page.read

# 3. Click by ref or coordinates
surf click --ref "e1"
surf click --x 100 --y 200

# 4. Type text
surf type --text "hello"

# 5. Full-page screenshot
surf screenshot --full-page --output /tmp/shot.png

# Inspect animation/style changes as JSON
surf animate-audit --selector ".thing" --duration 2000 --fps 10
```

## AI Assistants (No API Keys)

Query AI models using your browser's logged-in session. Most require a login; **AI Mode (`aimode`) is the default** because it needs no login and works out of the box.

**ChatGPT is temporarily disabled** - use AI Mode (default), Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, or AI Studio instead.

### AI Mode (Google) — DEFAULT

Google's AI-powered search at `google.com/search?udm=50` (auto) or `?nem=143` (pro). No login required, public endpoint.

```bash
surf aimode "explain quantum computing"          # Default: pro mode (nem=143)
surf aimode "berita hari ini"                     # Indonesian: works (auto mode)
surf aimode "summarize" --auto                    # Force auto mode (udm=50, has copy button)
surf aimode "deep dive" --timeout 300             # Extended timeout (default 120s)
```

**When to pick pro vs auto:**
- `--auto` (`udm=50`) — standard AI Mode, faster, exposes a copy button on the response
- default (`nem=143`) — pro mode, deeper reasoning, slower on complex prompts

**Why this is the default:** no auth needed, no rate-limit hit on free queries, and Indonesian/Indonesian-context prompts work reliably because Google handles the full search+generation pipeline.

### ChatGPT (when enabled)

```bash
surf chatgpt "explain this code"
surf chatgpt "summarize" --with-page              # Include current page context
surf chatgpt "review" --model gpt-5.5             # Specify model
surf chatgpt "analyze" --file document.pdf        # With file attachment
```

### Oracle

Use `surf chatgpt` for quick one-shot questions. Use `surf oracle` for long-running or Pro coding consults that need a durable job, explicit model and effort selection, file context, a direct local attachment, recovery, or follow-up turns. Oracle is local-only.

For agent workflows, detach after dispatch and keep the returned `.id`:

```bash
surf oracle ask "Review this change and identify release risks" \
  --files "src/**/*.ts" --files "package.json" \
  --model gpt-5.5 --effort pro --file ./design.md --github --detach --json

surf oracle status <job-id> --json
surf oracle result <job-id> --json
# Or let Surf keep polling until capture:
surf oracle result <job-id> --wait --json
```

`status` reads persisted state without touching Chrome. `result` attempts to harvest the answer and returns the job object with `response` once its state is `captured`. A Ctrl-C during waiting exits with status 130 and prints `Recover with: surf oracle result <id>`. Once the job is `awaiting`, the persisted ChatGPT conversation URL is its durable key, so `surf oracle result <id>` can recover after CLI exit, native-host restart, or Chrome restart by reopening that conversation.

Treat Pro quota as scarce. Oracle never selects Pro effort implicitly; request it with `--effort pro`. ChatGPT model aliases include `gpt-6-astra`, `latest`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, and `gpt-5.5`; `latest` is an explicit floating choice, while `gpt-6-astra` must read back as model 6 before submission. Accepted `--effort` values are `instant`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`/`extra-high`, and `pro`. Use `--model gpt-6-astra --effort pro` for GPT-6 Astra with Pro effort. Requested model and effort selections are read back before submission, and an unverifiable selection fails with `model_verification_failed` instead of silently continuing. Capacity is one non-terminal oracle job. A `capacity` error includes the in-flight job ID; poll that job or wait for it to finish rather than submitting the same consult again.

ChatGPT can hide the model version at lower effort settings. Use `--model latest` if floating model selection is intended; do not retry an unverifiable `gpt-6-astra` request as `latest` without the user's approval.

When loaded as a Pi extension, Surf also registers a `surf-oracle` external-job provider when the runtime exposes that bridge. The provider maps `start`, `status`, `result`, and `reattach` to durable Surf Oracle jobs and returns pi-subagents' external-job contract shape: `providerJobId`, a contract state (`queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`), the conversation URL, the captured result text as `output`, and failure code and message. It honors `options.model`, `options.effort`, `options.file`, and `options.github` for starts and follow-ups, so `model: gpt-6-astra` plus `effort: pro` selects ChatGPT GPT-6 Astra with Pro effort through the browser, while `github: true` requires Chat mode and the connected GitHub tool. `reattach` only harvests an existing job by ID; it never submits the prompt again.

When Surf is installed as a Pi package, it exposes an optional `gpt-pro` package agent for `pi-subagents`. That profile uses `runner.type: external-job`, provider `surf-oracle`, `options.model: gpt-6-astra`, and `options.effort: pro`. Surf remains useful without Pi or `pi-subagents`.

Context comes from repeatable `--files` globs. Use `--file <path>` for one additional local attachment; `--github` requires Chat mode and a connected GitHub tool. Surf fails closed when a glob matches nothing or a matched file is unreadable, binary, or invalid UTF-8. It also blocks gitignored files and basenames matching `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `credentials*`, or `secrets*`. Use `--allow-sensitive` only after intentionally reviewing those files; it overrides the block rather than redacting content. Context up to 60,000 evidence characters is inserted inline, while larger context becomes one private text attachment. The assembly manifest records each path, byte count, SHA-256, inline or bundle disposition, and deny-list outcome.

Continue a captured consult with `follow`. Use the ID returned by each turn for the next turn:

```bash
surf oracle follow <job-id> "Challenge your recommendation. What could invalidate it?" --file ./follow-up.md --github --detach --json
surf oracle result <follow-job-id> --wait --json
surf oracle follow <follow-job-id> "Give the final decision and concrete next steps." --detach --json
```

### Gemini
```bash
surf gemini "explain quantum computing"
surf gemini "summarize" --with-page               # Include page context
surf gemini "analyze" --file data.csv             # Attach file
surf gemini "a robot surfing" --generate-image /tmp/robot.png
surf gemini "add sunglasses" --edit-image photo.jpg --output out.jpg
surf gemini "summarize" --youtube "https://youtube.com/..."
surf gemini "hello" --model gemini-3.5-flash      # Models: gemini-3.1-pro (default), gemini-3.5-flash, gemini-3.1-flash-lite
surf gemini "wide banner" --generate-image /tmp/banner.png --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

### Perplexity

Uses the **deep-link URL pattern** (`https://www.perplexity.ai/#?q=...&model=...&focus=...&space=...`) so the page boots already configured — no need to script the typePrompt / selectModel / submitPrompt dance.

**Default model:** `claude46sonnetthinking` (Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking). Picked as the most reliable for exact-format output in head-to-head PONG tests against other Pro thinking models.

```bash
surf perplexity "what is quantum computing"            # Default: Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking
surf perplexity "explain this page" --with-page        # Include page context
surf perplexity "deep dive" --mode research            # Research mode (Pro)
surf perplexity "latest news" --focus web               # Web focus
surf perplexity "ticker $AAPL" --focus edgar            # Finance (SEC filings)
surf perplexity "..." --space <spaceId>                # Run inside a Perplexity Space
```

**Model selection** (Pro users): use the `reasoning_model` field from `https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/models/config` as the `--model` value — that's the model id Perplexity uses for Thinking mode. Top Pro thinking picks:

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `claude46sonnetthinking` (default) | Best format compliance |
| `gemini31pro_high` | Highest intelligence among Pro picks |
| `gpt54_thinking` | Top Pro reasoning |
| `kimik26thinking` | Strong reasoning alt |
| `nv_nemotron_3_ultra` | NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra |

**Max-tier models** (e.g. `gpt55_thinking`, `claude48opusthinking`) are silently rejected for Pro subscribers — pick a Pro-tier `reasoning_model` id.

**Focus values:** `writing, web, social, scholar, edgar` (comma-separated, e.g. `--focus writing,scholar`).

### Claude
```bash
surf claude "explain this code"
surf claude "summarize" --with-page              # Include current page context
surf claude "analyze" --model claude-opus-4      # Specify model (default: claude-opus-4)
```

### Grok (via x.com - requires X.com login in Chrome)
```bash
surf grok "what are the latest AI trends on X"    # Search X posts
surf grok "analyze @username recent activity"     # Profile analysis  
surf grok "summarize this page" --with-page       # Include page context
surf grok "find viral AI posts" --deep-search     # DeepSearch mode
surf grok "quick question" --model fast           # Models: auto, fast, expert, grok-4.20-beta
```

For exhaustive, multi-angle X research with categorized findings and full post-URL traceability, use the `deep-x-research` skill (`skills/deep-x-research/`) instead of a single Grok query.

**Grok Validation & Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Validate Grok UI and check available models (no query sent)
surf grok --validate

# If models changed, save discovered models to surf.json config
surf grok --validate --save-models
```

### AI Studio (via aistudio.google.com - requires Google login in Chrome)
```bash
surf aistudio "explain quantum computing"
surf aistudio "redteam this" --with-page          # Include current page context
surf aistudio "quick answer" --model gemini-3-flash-preview  # Model selection
surf aistudio "analyze" --timeout 600             # Custom timeout (default: 300s)
```

**Why AI Studio over Gemini?** AI Studio gives access to less restricted Gemini models. For Gemini 3 Pro the difference can be significant with certain prompts. Downside: aggressive per-day rate limits on Pro and Flash models.

**Model selection is best-effort:** Pass any AI Studio model id (e.g. `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-flash-lite-latest`). If the model isn't found, AI Studio uses whatever model was last selected in the UI.

### AI Studio App Builder
```bash
surf aistudio.build "build a portfolio site"
surf aistudio.build "todo app" --model gemini-3.1-pro-preview   # Model override
surf aistudio.build "crm dashboard" --output ./out              # Extract zip to directory
surf aistudio.build "game" --keep-open --timeout 600            # Keep tab open, 10min timeout
```

Automates AI Studio's App Builder at `aistudio.google.com/apps`. Types your prompt, clicks Build, waits for completion, downloads the generated zip, and optionally extracts it.

- `--output <dir>` extracts the zip to a directory
- `--model <id>` overrides the model in Advanced Settings
- `--timeout <seconds>` build timeout (default: 600s)
- `--keep-open` leaves the AI Studio tab open after completion

Returns `zipPath`, `extractedPath`, `model`, `buildDuration`, and `tookMs`.

### AI Tool Troubleshooting

When AI queries fail, check these common issues:

1. **Not logged in**: The error "login required" means you need to log into the service in Chrome (chatgpt.com, gemini.google.com, perplexity.ai, x.com, or aistudio.google.com)
2. **Model selection failed**: The UI may have changed. Run `surf grok --validate` to check
3. **Response timeout**: Reasoning-heavy models (ChatGPT o1, Grok Expert) can take 45+ seconds. AI Studio builds can take several minutes.
4. **Element not found**: The service's UI changed. Check for surf-cli updates

**Debugging workflow for agents:**
```bash
# 1. Check if the service is accessible and UI is valid
surf grok --validate

# 2. If models mismatch, update the local settings
surf grok --validate --save-models

# 3. Retry with explicit model name from validation output
surf grok "query" --model <model-from-validation>

# 4. If still failing, try with longer timeout
surf grok "query" --timeout 600
```

## Tab Management

```bash
surf tab.list
surf tab.new "https://google.com"
surf tab.switch 12345
surf tab.close 12345
surf tab.move 12345 --to-window 67890
surf tab.reload                # Reload current tab

# Named tabs (aliases)
surf tab.name myapp            # Name current tab
surf tab.switch myapp          # Switch by name
surf tab.named                 # List named tabs
surf tab.unname myapp          # Remove name

# Tab groups
surf tab.group                 # Create/add to tab group
surf tab.ungroup               # Remove from group
surf tab.groups                # List all tab groups
```

Commands without `--tab-id` run in a dedicated background Surf tab that surf
creates automatically — never your active tab. Pass `--tab-id <id>` to target
a specific tab.

## Window Management

```bash
surf window.list                              # List all windows
surf resize 1280 720                         # Resize current browser window
surf resize 1280                             # Set current window width only
surf window.list --tabs                       # Include tab details
surf window.new                               # New window (always background, never steals focus)
surf window.new --url "https://example.com"   # New window with URL
surf window.new --incognito                   # New incognito window
surf window.focus 12345                       # No-op: returns window info (policy: surf never focuses)
surf window.close 12345                       # Close window
surf window.resize --id 123 --width 1920 --height 1080
surf window.resize --id 123 --state maximized # States: normal, minimized, maximized, fullscreen
```

**Concurrent agent sessions:**

```bash
# Required first command rule for each independent agent shell
export SURF_SESSION="$(basename "$PWD" | sed 's/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]/-/g')"
surf session.ensure "$SURF_SESSION" about:blank

# Explicit form when an environment variable is inconvenient
surf --session research go "https://example.com"
surf --session research read

# Inspect bindings and scheduler state
surf session.list --refresh
surf session.info research --refresh
```

Each session owns one explicit tab and defaults to a separate unfocused window. Commands for the same tab are FIFO; different session tabs may run concurrently. Browser-wide writers wait for tab lanes to drain. `--no-wait` returns `tab_busy` or `browser_busy` immediately. On `tab_gone` or `session_epoch_stale`, run the exact command printed after `Recovery:`—normally `surf session.reopen <name>`.

Browser-login provider commands (`chatgpt`, `gemini`, `perplexity`, `grok`, `kimi`, `aistudio`, and `oracle ask`) take exclusive browser access and print a warning before dispatch. Do not assume Surf is hung while that warning is visible; inspect `surf session.info <name>` from another shell to see the active writer.

Sessions share cookies, authentication, same-origin storage, downloads, history, bookmarks, and other Chrome-profile state. Use separate browser/profile instances and `SURF_SOCKET` values only when hard isolation is required. Explicit `--tab-id`, `--window-id`, and named tabs remain available for one-off targeting.

## Input Methods

```bash
# CDP method (real events) types at the current focus
surf type --text "hello"
surf click --x 100 --y 200

# Selector/ref targets use frame-aware DOM input
surf type "hello" --into "#input"
surf type "hello" --ref e5

# Keys
surf key Enter
surf key "cmd+a"
surf key.repeat --key Tab --count 5           # Repeat key presses

# Hover and drag
surf hover --ref e5
surf drag --from-x 100 --from-y 100 --to-x 200 --to-y 200
```

## Page Inspection

```bash
surf page.read                 # Accessibility tree with refs + page text
surf page.read --no-text       # Interactive elements only (no text content)
surf animate-audit --selector ".thing" --duration 2000 --fps 10  # JSON animation timeline
surf page.read --ref e5        # Get specific element details
surf page.read --depth 3       # Limit tree depth
surf page.read --compact       # Minimal output for LLM efficiency
surf page.read --max-bytes 2000 # Cap visible text at a UTF-8 byte boundary
surf page.text                 # Plain text content only
surf page.html --strip-scripts # Rendered HTML without scripts
surf page.save --selector "#artifact" --strip-scripts --output page.html # Save one static element
surf page.state                # Modals, loading state, scroll info
```

### Export Rendered HTML

Use `page.html` when the user wants a static copy of the current rendered DOM. This works for Claude artifact pages and ordinary web pages.

```bash
# Save the active page as HTML.
surf page.save --output page.html

# Save a Claude artifact or other preview page after it loads, without scripts.
surf wait.dom --stable 500
surf page.html --selector "#artifact" --strip-scripts > artifact.html
```

Use `--selector <css>` to export its matching element only. A selector miss fails with an error. `--strip-scripts` removes scripts from exported markup without changing the page. Without `--selector`, `page.html` exports the whole document with its doctype. `page.html` exports the selected frame when `frame.switch` is active. Use `page.read` first when you need refs or visible text.

## Semantic Element Location

Find and act on elements by role, text, or label instead of refs:

```bash
# Find by ARIA role
surf locate.role button --name "Submit" --action click
surf locate.role textbox --name "Email" --action fill --value "test@example.com"
surf locate.role link --all                    # Return all matches

# Find by text content
surf locate.text "Sign In" --action click
surf locate.text "Accept" --exact --action click

# Find form field by label
surf locate.label "Username" --action fill --value "john"
surf locate.label "Password" --action fill --value "secret"
```

**Actions:** `click`, `fill`, `hover`, `text` (get text content)

## Text Search

```bash
surf search "login"                    # Find text in page
surf search "Error" --case-sensitive   # Case-sensitive
surf search "button" --limit 5         # Limit results
surf find "login"                      # Alias for search
```

## Element Inspection

```bash
surf element.styles e5                 # Get computed styles by ref
surf element.styles ".card"            # Or by CSS selector
# Returns: font, color, background, border, padding, bounding box
```

## Scrolling

```bash
surf scroll down 800           # Scroll down 800px
surf scroll up 400             # Scroll up 400px
surf scroll bottom             # Scroll to bottom
surf scroll top                # Scroll to top
surf scroll.bottom             # Dot command form also works
surf scroll.top
surf scroll.to --ref e5        # Scroll element into view
surf scroll.info               # Get scroll position
```

## Waiting

```bash
surf wait 2                    # Wait 2 seconds
surf wait.element ".loaded"    # Wait for element
surf wait.network              # Wait for network idle
surf wait.url "/success"       # Wait for URL pattern
surf wait.dom --stable 100     # Wait for DOM stability
surf wait.load                 # Wait for page load complete
```

## Dialog Handling

```bash
surf dialog.info               # Get current dialog type/message
surf dialog.accept             # Accept (OK)
surf dialog.accept --text "response"  # Accept prompt with text
surf dialog.dismiss            # Dismiss (Cancel)
```

## Device/Network Emulation

```bash
# Network throttling
surf emulate.network slow-3g   # Presets: slow-3g, fast-3g, 4g, offline
surf emulate.network reset     # Disable throttling

# CPU throttling  
surf emulate.cpu 4             # 4x slower
surf emulate.cpu 1             # Reset

# Device emulation (19 presets)
surf emulate.device "iPhone 14"
surf emulate.device "Pixel 7"
surf emulate.device --list     # List available devices

# Custom viewport
surf emulate.viewport --width 1280 --height 720
surf emulate.touch --enable    # Enable touch emulation

# Geolocation
surf emulate.geo --lat 37.7749 --lon -122.4194
surf emulate.geo --clear
```

## Form Automation

```bash
surf page.read                 # Get element refs first

# Fill by ref
surf form.fill --data '[{"ref":"e1","value":"John"},{"ref":"e2","value":"john@example.com"}]'

# Checkboxes: true/false
surf form.fill --data '[{"ref":"e7","value":true}]'

# Dropdown selection
surf select e5 "Option A"                    # By value (default)
surf select e5 "Option A" "Option B"         # Multi-select
surf select e5 --by label "Display Text"     # By visible label
surf select e5 --by index 2                  # By index (0-based)
```

## File Upload

```bash
surf upload --ref e5 --files "/path/to/file.txt"
surf upload --ref e5 --files "/path/file1.txt,/path/file2.txt"
```

## Iframe Handling

```bash
surf frame.list                # List frames with IDs
surf frame.switch --selector "#payment-iframe"
surf frame.switch --name "checkout"
surf frame.switch --index 0    # First iframe
surf frame.main                # Return to main frame
surf frame.js "return document.title" --id "FRAME_ID"

# After frame.switch, subsequent commands target that frame:
surf frame.switch --selector "#payment-iframe"
surf page.read                 # Reads iframe content
surf click --selector "#pay"   # Clicks in iframe
surf frame.main                # Back to main page
```

## Network Inspection

```bash
surf network                   # List captured requests
surf network --stream          # Real-time network events
surf network.get --id "req-123"   # Full request details
surf network.body --id "req-123"  # Get response body
surf network.curl --id "req-123"  # Generate curl command
surf network.origins           # List origins with stats
surf network.stats             # Capture statistics
surf network -vv --body-mode text --per-body-bytes 65536
surf network.export --har --output ./trace.har
surf network.clear             # Clear captured requests
```

Response-body capture supports `none`, `text`, and `all` modes plus per-body and per-tab-session byte caps. HAR exports carry body completeness metadata. Persistent network state is private under `~/.surf/state/network/` by default; configure `SURF_NETWORK_PATH` in the native host environment to change it.

## Console

```bash
surf console                   # Get console messages
surf console --stream          # Real-time console
surf console --stream --level error  # Errors only
```

## JavaScript Execution

```bash
surf js "return document.title"
surf js "document.querySelector('.btn').click()"
```

## Performance

```bash
surf perf.metrics              # Current metrics snapshot
surf perf.start                # Start trace
surf perf.stop                 # Stop and get results
```

## Screenshots

```bash
surf screenshot                           # Auto-saves to /tmp/surf-snap-*.png
surf screenshot --output /tmp/shot.png    # Save to specific file
surf screenshot --selector ".card"        # Element only
surf screenshot --full-page               # Full page scroll capture
surf screenshot --full-page /tmp/full.png # Full page saved to path
surf screenshot --no-save                 # Return base64 only, don't save file
```

## Zoom

```bash
surf zoom                      # Get current zoom level
surf zoom 1.5                  # Set zoom to 150%
surf zoom 1                    # Reset to 100%
```

## Cookies & Storage

```bash
surf cookie list               # List cookies for current page
surf cookie list --domain .google.com
surf cookie set --name "token" --value "abc123"
surf cookie get "token"
surf cookie clear --all        # Clear all cookies
surf cookie delete "token"     # Clear one cookie
```

## History & Bookmarks

```bash
surf history --query "github" --max 20
surf bookmarks --query "docs"
surf bookmark.add --url "https://..." --title "My Bookmark"
surf bookmark.remove
```

## Health Checks & Smoke Tests

```bash
surf health --url "http://localhost:3000"
surf smoke --urls "http://localhost:3000" "http://localhost:3000/about"
surf smoke --urls "..." --screenshot /tmp/smoke
```

## Workflows

Execute multi-step browser automation as a single command with smart auto-waits.

### Inline Workflows

```bash
# Pipe-separated commands
surf do 'go "https://example.com" | click e5 | screenshot'

# Multi-step login flow
surf do 'go "https://example.com/login" | type "user@example.com" --selector "#email" | type "pass" --selector "#password" | click --selector "button[type=submit]"'

# JSON action batch. Uses SURF_SESSION when it is set.
surf batch --actions '[{"type":"frame.switch","index":0},{"type":"click","selector":"#pay"}]'

# Validate without executing
surf do 'go "url" | click e5' --dry-run
```

### Named Workflows

Save workflows as JSON files in `~/.surf/workflows/` (user) or `./.surf/workflows/` (project):

```bash
# List available workflows
surf workflow.list

# Show workflow details
surf workflow.info my-workflow

# Run by name with arguments
surf do my-workflow --email "user@example.com" --password "secret"

# Validate workflow file
surf workflow.validate workflow.json
```

### Workflow JSON Format

```json
{
  "name": "Login Flow",
  "description": "Automate login process",
  "args": {
    "email": { "required": true },
    "password": { "required": true },
    "url": { "default": "https://example.com/login" }
  },
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "navigate", "args": { "url": "%{url}" } },
    { "tool": "type", "args": { "text": "%{email}", "selector": "input[name=email]" } },
    { "tool": "type", "args": { "text": "%{password}", "selector": "input[name=password]" } },
    { "tool": "click", "args": { "selector": "button[type=submit]" } },
    { "tool": "screenshot", "args": {}, "as": "result" }
  ]
}
```

### Loops and Step Outputs

```json
{
  "steps": [
    // Capture step output for later use
    { "tool": "js", "args": { "code": "return [1,2,3]" }, "as": "items" },
    
    // Fixed iterations
    { "repeat": 5, "steps": [
      { "tool": "click", "args": { "ref": "e5" } }
    ]},
    
    // Iterate over array
    { "each": "%{items}", "as": "item", "steps": [
      { "tool": "js", "args": { "code": "console.log('%{item}')" } }
    ]},
    
    // Repeat until condition
    { "repeat": 20, "until": { "tool": "js", "args": { "code": "return done" } }, "steps": [...] }
  ]
}
```

### Workflow Options

```bash
--file, -f <path>     # Load from JSON file
--dry-run             # Parse and validate without executing
--on-error stop|continue  # Error handling (default: stop)
--step-delay <ms>     # Delay between steps (default: 100, 0 to disable)
--no-auto-wait        # Disable automatic waits
--json                # Structured JSON output
```

**Auto-waits:** Commands automatically wait for completion:
- Navigation (`go`, `back`, `forward`) → waits for page load
- Clicks, key presses, form fills → waits for DOM stability
- Tab switches → waits for tab to load

**Why use `do`?** Instead of 6-8 separate CLI calls with LLM orchestration between each, a workflow executes deterministically. Faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

## Playbooks

Use `surf do` for a direct command sequence. Use a playbook for a reusable site capability with provenance, browser-session network execution, workflow fallback, and write-safety policy.

```bash
surf playbook list
surf pb show page
surf pb ops page
surf use page read --json
```

Resolution order is project (`./.surf/playbooks/`), user (`~/.surf/playbooks/`), then built-in. Provider compatibility commands stay on their validated command paths until provider playbooks have real login-flow validation. A write op requires `--write`; Surf records semantic intent before dispatch so a timeout or concurrent retry cannot silently double-submit.

Author from redacted recent activity when it contains only read/navigation behavior, or use an explicit record for richer evidence:

```bash
surf pb suggest --since 1h
surf pb save example --op read --from-recent 1h
surf pb record start example --op read --network --watch
surf pb record mark "loaded results"
surf pb record stop --draft
surf pb save --from-record <record-id>
surf pb trace export --from-record <record-id> --har ./trace.har
surf pb export example --out ./example-playbook
surf pb import ./example-playbook
```

Records, trace slices, receipts, and the bounded activity journal are private Surf state. Inputs and authentication headers are redacted by default. Use `--include-input-values` only when the saved values are necessary and acceptable.

Client projections replay a validated read endpoint and never embed captured browser credentials:

```bash
surf pb client derive example --op read --from-record <record-id> --request-id <request-id> --out ./client
surf pb client export example --op read --out ./client
surf pb client verify ./client
```

## Error Diagnostics

```bash
# Auto-capture screenshot + console on failure
surf wait.element ".missing" --auto-capture --timeout 2000
# Saves to /tmp/surf-error-*.png
```

## Common Options

```bash
--session <name>      # Target a durable named session (or set SURF_SESSION)
--tab-id <id>         # Target a specific tab
--window-id <id>      # Target a specific window
--no-wait             # Return tab_busy/browser_busy instead of queueing
--json                # Raw JSON including target metadata
--auto-capture        # Screenshot + console on error
--timeout <ms>        # Override default timeout
```

## Tips

1. **First CDP operation is slow** (~5-8s) - debugger attachment overhead, subsequent calls fast
2. **Use refs from page.read** for reliable element targeting over CSS selectors
3. **JS method for contenteditable** - Modern editors (ChatGPT, Claude, Notion) need `--method js`
4. **Named tabs for workflows** - `tab.name app` then `tab.switch app`
5. **Auto-capture for debugging** - `--auto-capture` saves diagnostics on failure
6. **AI tools use browser session** - Must be logged into the service (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, AI Studio), no API keys needed
7. **Grok validation** - Run `surf grok --validate` if queries fail to check UI changes
8. **Long timeouts for reasoning-heavy models** - ChatGPT o1 and Grok Expert can take 60+ seconds. AI Studio builds default to 600s.
9. **AI Studio for unrestricted Gemini** - `surf aistudio` gives less filtered responses than `surf gemini` for the same models
10. **Use `surf do` for multi-step tasks** - Reduces token overhead and improves reliability
11. **Dry-run workflows first** - `surf do '...' --dry-run` validates without executing
12. **Session first** - Set a unique `SURF_SESSION` and run `session.ensure` before the first browser command in every independent agent shell
13. **Queue diagnostics** - `session.info` distinguishes the session's own tab queue, other active tabs, and browser-wide writers; use `--no-wait` for immediate busy errors
14. **Native host diagnostics** - If commands fail with socket/native-host errors, run `surf doctor` or `surf doctor --browser all` before guessing at reinstall steps
15. **Animation capture** - Use `surf record --duration 2000 --fps 10 --output /tmp/anim.gif` when the agent needs to see motion; use `animate-audit` for numeric timelines and `perf-audit` for jank/layout-shift snapshots
16. **Hard isolation** - Sessions share a Chrome profile; use separate browser/profile instances plus separate `SURF_SOCKET` values when profile state must not be shared
17. **HTML export** - Use `surf page.html > artifact.html` to save Claude artifacts or any rendered page as static HTML
18. **Perplexity default = Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking** - Picked for format compliance; override with `--model <id>` from `/rest/models/config`. Perplexity's "Thinking" toggle is the `reasoning_model` field, not a URL flag — pass that id to `?model=...`
18. **Semantic locators** - `locate.role`, `locate.text`, `locate.label` for more robust element finding
19. **Frame context** - Use `frame.switch` before interacting with iframe content

## Socket API

For programmatic access:

```bash
echo '{"type":"tool_request","method":"execute_tool","params":{"tool":"tab.list","args":{}},"id":"1"}' | nc -U /tmp/surf.sock
```

<!-- SLOW_UPDATE_START -->
When you respond to a surf skill request, follow these rules strictly:

**1. Out-of-scope requests (general Python, curl, HTML parsing, non-browser HTTP, BeautifulSoup, scrapy, etc.):**
Decline in EXACTLY 1–2 sentences. Give one command or one import line as a pointer, then STOP. No more, no less.

FORBIDDEN patterns (will cause failure):
- Multi-section essays with headers like 'What I can do / What I cannot do / Alternatives / Confidence'
- Listing multiple adjacent libraries (requests, httpx, aiohttp, urllib, bs4, lxml, scrapy, etc.) — pick ONE
- Bullet lists of library options
- Closing paragraphs asking 'let me know if you'd like help with X' (one short sentence is fine, but no laundry list)
- Explaining why it falls outside scope beyond a single short clause

Correct decline shape (use this template):
> That's a general Python task, not a surf command. For your case, use: `requests.get(url).text` (or `curl -O <url>`). Let me know if you actually want to drive Chrome.

**2. Missing URL/tab (e.g., 'get the title of that page'):**
Ask for the missing input in ONE line. Then stop.

FORBIDDEN:
- Enumerating fallback chains (og:title, h1, URL slug, document.title, etc.) unless explicitly asked
- Pre-writing fallback extraction code
- Adding confidence levels or source attribution
- Showing what commands you'll run once they provide the URL

Correct shape:
> Need the URL to run `surf navigate <url> && surf js "return document.title"`. Which page?

**3. User asks for 'minimal output' / 'one line' / 'just the answer' / 'tanpa penjelasan':**
HONOR IT COMPLETELY. Give the answer in one line and stop. Do not add caveats, justification, principles, or 'Notes' sections.

FORBIDDEN:
- Refusing 'for transparency' or 'for clarity' reasons
- Adding principle statements like 'I won't collapse to one line for transparency'
- Adding 'Notes' / 'Catatan' sections after the one-liner
- Prepending apologetic or explanatory clauses

If the user says minimal/one-line, output exactly one line. Period.

**4. In-scope browser tasks with a URL:**
Keep the current pattern (commands + 2–4 brief notes). This is working — do not shorten it further. Do not lengthen it either.

**5. When unsure whether a task fits the skill:**
Try to make it fit. If the user mentions a URL, page, browser, screenshot, click, fill, HTML rendering, JS execution, DevTools, or any web interaction, assume it is in scope and produce the surf commands. Only decline when the request is clearly non-browser (Python script, pure shell command, library install, parser config, asking explicitly to use curl instead of surf).

If the user EXPLICITLY asks to use curl instead of surf, give a 1-sentence acknowledgement that curl is the right tool (`curl -s <url>`), then stop. Do NOT enumerate what surf can do, do NOT list alternatives, do NOT add confidence scores. One sentence, then stop.

**6. Structure surfacing vs. brevity tradeoff:**
When the user's prompt itself asks for structured output (title, source, confidence, fallback chain), include that structure. When the user does not ask for structure, do NOT invent it. The skill rubric is not a request from the user.

**7. Meta-commentary is forbidden:**
Never write paragraphs about what you're doing, why you're declining, what you noticed about the prompt, or how the rubric works. Just respond to the user. The user does not care about your internal reasoning. Start with the answer or the request for clarification — nothing else.

**Quick self-check before responding:**
- Did I write more than 2 sentences for a decline? → Cut it.
- Did I add a 'Notes' section when the user asked for minimal? → Remove it.
- Did I list 3+ library alternatives? → Pick one.
- Did I explain why the request is out of scope? → Cut the explanation.
- Did I write 'Let me know if...' plus a list of follow-up options? → Cut the list.
